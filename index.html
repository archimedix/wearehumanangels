We have written our books driven by the desire to share our healing journey, a trip through the illusions of the ego to our rebirth in the Oneness. &nbsp;We have chosen to stay anonymous but we have agreed to being interviewed by some spiritual maganizes, such as Om Times Radio Circle of Hearts Show, Connecting with Angels hosted by Sheri Myers and Inner Peace Master Class by Julie Cairnes</p>
